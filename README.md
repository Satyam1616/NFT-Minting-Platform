# NFT Minting Platform on Aptos

This project is a simple NFT minting platform built on the Aptos blockchain. It allows users to mint their own NFTs by providing their account address and a token URI that points to the NFT metadata.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Aptos CLI
- A code editor (like VS Code)

## Setup

### Smart Contract Development

1. **Install Aptos CLI**:
   Follow the instructions in the [Aptos CLI documentation](https://aptos.dev/tutorials/cli) to install the Aptos CLI.

2. **Create a new Aptos project**:
   ```bash
   mkdir nft_minting
   cd nft_minting
   aptos move init
Implement the NFT minting smart contract: Create a new file in the move directory called nft_minting.move and add your smart contract code.

Compile the contract:
aptos move compile

Publish the package: Make sure your profile is set to devnet or testnet in the Aptos configuration
aptos move publish --package-dir move --profile devnet

Frontend Development
Create a new React app: In a separate directory, create your React app using Create React App.

npx create-react-app aptos-nft-minting
cd aptos-nft-minting

nstall dependencies: Install the Aptos SDK:
npm install aptos

Create the MintNFT component: Create a new folder named components and a file named MintNFT.js for your NFT minting component. Copy the minting logic into this file.

Add styling: Create a App.css file in the src directory and add the provided CSS styles.

Import the MintNFT component in App.js: Update src/App.js to include the MintNFT component.

Running the Application
Start your React app: In the terminal, navigate to the aptos-nft-minting directory and run:

npm start

Open your browser: Visit http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

Interacting with the Application
Fill in the Account Address: Enter your Aptos account address. If you donâ€™t have one, you can create it using the Aptos CLI.
Enter the Token URI: Provide the metadata URI for your NFT. This should point to a JSON file hosted on IPFS, GitHub Pages, or a cloud storage service.
Click the "Mint NFT" button: This will initiate the minting process. You will see loading feedback, and upon success, a success message will be displayed.
Troubleshooting
"Failed to mint NFT.": Check the following:
Ensure your account address is correct and funded.
Verify the token URI points to a valid JSON file containing NFT metadata.
Move compilation issues: Make sure you have installed all dependencies correctly and that your smart contract code is error-free.
